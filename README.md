# hello-world
the first project of my programming

Good after noon world!

This is xoxoby.

I received my bachelor degree in electrical engineering and automation from Zhejiang University.
To further my education backgrounds, I accepted offer of admission from UC San Diego majoring in intelligent systems and robotic controls.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I am not able to attend school in the fall.

I've already deferred my admission to Fall2021 and spend my gap year in iFlytek as a software development intern.

Good Luck!
